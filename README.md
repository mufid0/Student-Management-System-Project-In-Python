# Student Management System (Python CLI Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Management System** is a simple **command-line based Python application** that allows users to manage student records efficiently.
It demonstrates core Python concepts such as **lists, functions, conditionals, loops, exception handling, and basic OS interaction**.
This project is suitable for **beginners and freshers** who want to showcase their Python fundamentals through a practical mini-project.

## 🎯 Features

* View all students in the system
* Add a new student
* Search for an existing student
* Remove a student
* Input validation using exception handling
* Option to re-run the program without restarting
* Cross-platform support (Windows / Linux / macOS)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Modules Used:**

  * `os` – to clear the terminal screen
  * `platform` – to detect operating system

## ⚙️ How the Program Works

1. The program starts with a predefined list of students.
2. A menu is displayed with four options:

   * View student list
   * Add a student
   * Search for a student
   * Remove a student
3. Based on the user’s choice, the corresponding operation is performed.
4. After execution, the user can choose to run the program again or exit.
5. On exit, a goodbye message is displayed.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3 installed on your system

### Steps

```bash
python student_management_system.py
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Operations

* **View Students:** Displays all students stored in the list
* **Add Student:** Prevents duplicate entries
* **Search Student:** Confirms whether a student exists
* **Remove Student:** Deletes a student only if found

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

This project helps in understanding:

* Python lists and list operations
* Functions and global variables
* Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
* Exception handling (`try-except`)
* Recursive function calls
* OS-level commands in Python

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Store data permanently using a file or database
* Add unique student IDs
* Convert the application into a GUI or web-based system
* Implement role-based access (Admin/User)
* Improve input validation and case-insensitive search
